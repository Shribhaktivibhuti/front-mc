          <h2>What is Pre-Marital Counseling?</h2>
          <p>
            Pre-marital counseling helps couples better understand each other
            and prepare for marriage and post-married life.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Benefits of Pre-Marital Counseling:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Gain clarity and understanding:</strong> Discuss topics
              that provide insights into what lies ahead in married life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Address overlooked issues:</strong> Explore areas that
              couples might have missed during courtship.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare for unforeseen challenges:</strong> For couples
              unable to "live-in" together before marriage, it offers guidance
              on navigating married life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prevent unexpected shocks:</strong> Helps couples align
              expectations and avoid surprises later in life.
            </li>
